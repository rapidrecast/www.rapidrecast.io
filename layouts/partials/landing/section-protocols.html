        <ul>
            <li>Your frontend team thrives with <span class="rapid-gradient-text">WebSockets</span> or <span class="rapid-gradient-text">HTTP 2 resource streams</span>.</li>
            <li>Your backend team prefers the structure and efficiency of <span class="rapid-gradient-text">gRPC</span>.</li>
            <li>Your infrastructure team everything centralised in <span class="rapid-gradient-text">Kafka</span>.</li>
            <li>Your data team finds power in <span class="rapid-gradient-text">Flink</span> for processing streams.</li>
            <li>Your hardware team relies on <span class="rapid-gradient-text">WebRTC</span> for seamless device communication.</li>
            <li>And sometimes, integrations demand the simplicity of <span class="rapid-gradient-text">HTTP Webhooks</span>.</li>
