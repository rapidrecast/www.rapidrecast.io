        <p>
            Clients often send simple, unbatched requests.
            While manageable individually, a surge of such requests can quickly create a backlog, straining your system until it scales out.
            This not only delays responses but also drives up operational costs as you add more replicas to handle the load.
        </p>
        <p>
            By batching similar requests, you can process them in bulk, dramatically improving system throughput without the need for additional infrastructure.
            RapidRecast makes this effortless by allowing you to assign requests to specific channels and consume responses directly from them.
        </p>
        <p>
            All you need to do is configure how to group requests — whether by payload fields, metadata, or other criteria — and RapidRecast takes care of the rest.
            With intelligent request batching, your systems run more efficiently, saving time and reducing costs.
