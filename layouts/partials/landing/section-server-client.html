            When you make a request, you’re initiating an action — pushing data or triggering a response.
            But as the one handling those requests, isn’t it frustrating to keep a live connection open just to receive inbound messages?
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional streaming APIs tie you to this model, forcing you to constantly manage live connections or repeatedly initialize requests by connecting to the service.
            It’s cumbersome and limits your flexibility.
