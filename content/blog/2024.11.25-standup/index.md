The theme of this week is to get the product into people's hands so I can get as much feedback as possible.

# What I achieved

Rocky start, I wanted to do too much at once.

## Marketing

- my comittment to myself to push out content regularly, including video
- moved website from old domain to new

## Admin

- set up the company, addresses, banking account, trademark application

## Product

- got the codebase into a working state
- re-thought how the components fit together and came up with a much better design from a testability, operability, and maintainability perspective
- fixed frustrations with website, like arrow SVG in the docs page taking up entire page (hack workaround)

## Sales

- Did a bit of research into how to approach this, will blog about findings and approach

# What I didn't achieve

- I wanted to do 30 outbound messages a day; I did zero. Fortunately I have done some outbound messages in the past so I have some idea of what it looks like. I also have a configured CRM with people to follow up with and I have populated it with about 70 people.
- I wanted to do a live stream of coding; I have not done a live stream because of how hectic things are, with admin being the most disruptive aspect. Unlikely to do live streams in near future as I benefit from those being more focused at the moment.
- I wanted to sort out my brand graphics; I have research fiverr people doing this service but not been in contact with anyone yet. I already have made a fair amout of writing/research into what I want my brand to represent and feel like.

# What I am doing this week

## Marketing

- More content, focused largely on market positioning and problem space
- Might work on a video if I have time, this is going to be short and about what streaming is. I want to utilise green screen this time and get a potrait view of the video.
- Docs pages

## Admin

- Get a better grasp of legal and finance situation

## Product

- Cloud offering this week, free
- Rearchitect so that I dont get swamped with tech debt (this could be a bad decision, but I think it is achievable in a few hours)
- As metnioned in marketing, docs

## Sales

- At least some outbound
- Refined pitch and offering

Till next time folks!
