# Exploration vs exploitation

I recently tried something slightly different.

So far, my north star for building a community has been to leverage LinkedIn.

I chose LinkedIn in particular for several reasons.
It seems to be more serious and profession focused.
It mixes video and text content in fairly equal measure.

If it works, why change things up?


# Reddit, the new frontier

I already had the content.
I already posted it to LinkedIn.
I wanted to get some new reach and experiment with re-packaging my content.
I shuffled the post up a bit.
You can find the diff of the post [here](link-todo).

This re-post achieves several things.

I reach people who are not directly interested in the product, who may remember it and apply it.

I build up (slowly, but surely) my recognition and appreciation in various communities - this time /r/rust.

I build up my Reddit karma :)

# What conclusions can be drawn

These are the 48h stats for the post on Reddit.

For comparison, here are the stats for the LinkedIn post.

Can we draw conclussions?
I think, the best conclusion we can come to is that it is always worth posting to various platforms.

The more specific the better - my LinkedIn engagement consists almost entirely of people I know.
Reddit, on the other hand, almost exclusively of strangers.
I got better engagement from Reddit, even though the click-through rate on the website was not as good.

The Reddit post is eternal.
I will be indexed in search results, and show up for people looking.
Who knows?
Maybe even the LLM chat bots will start refercing me :).
