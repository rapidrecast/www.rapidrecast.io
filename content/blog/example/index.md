# RapidRecast Launch

It's finally out into the public and I couldn't be more thankful to all my friends who are supporting me in this journey.

# What is the offering

RapidRecast is my effort to commiditise programming that every company is undertaking, but putting full time staff onto the effort.
There are 2 cases why I think this is useful:

1. Companies that are aware they need streaming RIGHT NOW and either already have it in place and are maintaining it or are in the process of designing it and will encounter the most common issues.
2. Companies that are not yet needing streaming but the technology would benefit them if it was in reach.

Both these clients can stand to gain from using my software, even if purely by saving maintenance costs or by reducing opportunity costs.

# Video

I decided to make my [first ever video](https://youtu.be/RWpNAPT3Fpc) and published it to Linkedin ONLY.
Why just Linkedin?
I don't want to add too much complexity as I iterate,and I think Linkedin will have a good enough reach for what I need to do.

There is a lot of work that needs to be done to gain momentum.
Product-market fit aside, people buy products that they have heard of and are familiar with.

If I asked you to get a doorbell, you would probably think of [Ring](https://en-uk.ring.com/pages/video-doorbell-cameras), as they seem to have the widest recognition.
So the way you would go about buying the product, is that you would evaluate competitors against Ring.
Or, perhaps, you wouldn't even put too much thought into it and you would just buy the product without much comparisson.

That is the power of a brand and why marketing is so essential.

# Reception

Nearly 24h after posting, my post has largely received a friendly reception from people I am familiar with.

Breaking the visible engagements down, they fall roughly into 2 categories.

| Category | Description / Classification | Count |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Friend | People who I am familiar with and can message "Hey, hows it going" | 45 |
| Very kind strangers | People who I have had a lower number of interactions with (or none) and would require a bit of formality | 8 |

The interactions are larger than I would have anticipated:
- I am not super outgoing, so my friends are kept to low digit numbers.
- I am extremly fortunate to have been surrounded by very friendly people in my life, who continue to be friendly and caring.
- Not all my friends who have congratulated me or seen the video have interacted with the post. This is absolutely fine and I really appreciate you all reaching out to me privately - thank you!

# Feedback

The feedback has been interesting to see.

Obviously, I am aware the video was low quality.
Nevertheless, I do want to know what particularly stands out - I might be suspecting the wrong flaws in execution.

## "You look unkempt"

The actual quote was slightly different, but I modified it to be more palettable.

Thank you, I have changed my shirt and I will remove the packaging from the table next time.

## "You look less tense than the other recordings, but still not your usual self"

This is true. I actually spent a lot of time trying to get this video right even the day before.
Goes to show, even something as simple as a quick update takes effort.

I had a script that I intended to read or memorise.
This proved not to be the right approach, since it comes across as very staged - even if you are naturally using the same phrases you would do normally.

Going from the heart with bullet points, but rehearsing the bullet points is the way to go.

I did not stick to the bullet points I had written down, since they contained too much detail.

## "Doing a stream-of-consciousness stream about streaming, love it"

It's true - after trying to get this right for a much longer time than I had wanted, I just decided to yolo it.
Bias to action is sometimes more important than getting things perfect.

I don't know if improving the quality of the video would have made much of a difference to my engagement numbers.
I will need to try harder to find out.

## "The lighting is much better in this one"

You can get cheap USB lights from Amazon.

## "Slouching"

This is actually really good feedback, as it is something i need to keep in mind all the time.

What I am doing is making a checklist of things to improve for the next video.

After each take that I like, I will go over the checklist to confirm if I am doing what I want.

The list includes
- slouching
- filler words
- script rehearsal for individual points, practiced in isolation
- overall appearance, camera view edges, background

# What is next

I want to have standup notes that I put out, showing what my focus is on for the week.
The website is taking up way too much time even though it is extremely simple.
Admin is also taking up more than I would like.

Hopefully the above can be useful for anyone wanting to follow this path.
