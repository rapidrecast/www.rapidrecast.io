The theme of this week is still to get the product into people's hands so I can get as much feedback as possible.

# What I achieved

## Marketing

- Learned Adobe Animate.
- Got feedback that I need to focus more on core offering instead of progress updates and non-criticial information.
- Figured out the greenscreen for OBS.
- Decided to create a Linkedin community for [Realtime Streaming APIs](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13118544/). 
  - This is an un-branded community where I will post knowledge and people can share their perspective without a strong brand affiliation. Other brands are welcome to join.
- Started focusing on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rapidrecast.io) to get a community and following going.

## Admin

- Brand image is in motion. Shoutout to Jaime who selflessly offered and delivered a brand logo and colour scheme for me  - truly caring about employees through and through.
- Learned I need to be much more protective of my time: It is so easy to say "yes" to a call, catchup, outing, but they soon add up and make a very disruptive week.
- Learned I need to make time for myself or I get cranky - seemingly trivial, yet quite important.

## Product

- Solved a gnarly bug with my API where connections would be swallowed because of Tokio's async scheduler not picking up a task.
- Added more tests to prevent regressions from happening again.
- Put a box up on Hetzner for a free offering of the product, available from `cloud.rapidrecast.io`.

## Sales

- Made 20 outbound messages, mostly sourced from [Growth List](https://growthlist.co/london-startups/). Zero responses - will follow up more and try to tackle viable companies.
- Got very valuable feedback from [Ignacio Paz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciopaz87/) that I should go a bit easier on the outbound, so as not to intimidate potential users.
- I have a very exciting exploratory call this week, sourced from a friend facing the problem I solve.
- Created a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMRyOrgXcMiOKIVaDRqlkzsEqS-MfQD542om8TC446gvSK5A/viewform?usp=sf_link) for problem feedback.

# What I didn't achieve

- A cold outbound lead - still working towards this.
- My cloud offering still isn't at a place where I want it to be, as there are a few issues remaining.

# What I am doing this week

## Marketing

- Much more focused content, centered around use cases. I will be following the patterns for social posts: story telling, teaching, and personality. 

## Admin

- Get a better grasp of legal and finance situation.
- Manage time better to have a clearer separation between work and non-work.

## Product

- Cloud offering this week, free.
- Configuration API that allows to set how APIs and queues behave.

## Sales

- More cold sales outbound.
- More refinement of pitch.
- Working towards demos and demo videos.

Till next time folks!
