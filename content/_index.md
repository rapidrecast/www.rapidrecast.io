  - Title: "Streaming, as you like it"
    Description: "Create streams the way you want them: WebSockets, HTTP requests, Kafka, HTTP 2, HTTP 3, WebRTC, Spark, and many more."
    Section: "streaming-as-you-like-it"
  - Title: "Server and Client Capabilities"
    Description: "Wire your components together and forget if they are services or clients. You can even use Cron Expressions to make 2 APIs stream to each other - without a background ticker publishing to RapidRecast."
    Section: "server-client"
  - Title: "Synchronous or Asynchronous?"
    Description: "Synchronous requests are so convenient! Why not use RapidRecast to keep that simplicity?"
    Section: "sync-async"
  - Title: "Scalability"
    Description: "RapidRecast is built with scalability in mind. You won't need to explicitly declare partitions or shards. Just watch RapidRecast rebalance as replicas are added to the cluster."
    Section: "scalability"
  - Title: "Request Batching"
    Description: "If a single request takes 20ms, but a batch of 100 takes 30ms, then you would prefer to batch your requests, right? Gotcha fam."
    Section: "request-batching"
  - Title: "Rust all the way"
    Description: "Fans of <a href='https://tourofrust.com/chapter_1_en.html'>Ferris</a> and followers of <a href='https://youtu.be/Pw4VUHwfo2w?si=AqPs4l4iw1Fa3PXL&t=50'>Crabulon</a> will agree this is exciting. Rust brings performance and memory-safety to RapidRecast, and underpins what makes this software so fast."
    Section: "rust"
  - Title: "Near-zero Integration"
    Description: "Integration is scary. That is why RapidRecast tries to keep things simple. You should be able to simply point your endpoints at the service and start streaming."
    Section: "zero-integration"
  - Title: "Stability"
    Description: "RapidRecast is rigorously tested, the same way databases are. Randomised tests explore any possible edge cases, while also validating correctness of data."
    Section: "stability"
