The Schema Definition Language does not have a name yet.
In fact "Schema Definition Language" is a bit wrong.
It defines more than schemas.
It defines all the schemas, topics, protocols, patterns, requests and permissions.

The general idea is that it can be plaintext, but also JSON, YAML, TOML, and XML.

It will cover a lot of functionality and will be versioned in the system.
